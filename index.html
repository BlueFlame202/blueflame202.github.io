    <h2>Orange Juice</h2>
    <p>A backup of some of my orange juice stuff is <a href="orange-juice">hosted here</a>. Not everything is here though since this website is totally public.</p>

	  <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Originally I was going to make notes here in HTML, but things changed when I found out about Astro JS and markdown. I also ended up sticking to orange juice sketches for certain things. Still, you can see some initial notes at <a href="notes">the notes directory</a>.</p>
