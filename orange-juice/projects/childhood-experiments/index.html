        <p>In middle school and high school, I really prided myself in tinkering around with whatever was around the house. YouTubers like Nile Red (and several others) were always there to inspire me.</p>
        <p>To me, chemistry and mathematics were always about playing around with whatever is available. I hope to compile this guide for others to play around with some of the things they have at home.</p>
        <h2>Materials: Science</h2>
        <p>So many objects around the house can be used for interesting experimentation. Here are a few:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Cardboard:</b> Good material for building structures. Different types of boxes have different stiffness properties, which can be useful for different things.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Toilet paper roll cardboard is particularly useful for organization and its thickness, along with the cardboard centers of duct tape or painters tape rolls.</li>
                <li>Many YouTubers have made incredible contraptions with just cardboard, a hobby knife, and rubber bands. It's definitely an incredible art and science.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Pennies:</b> Copper-plated zinc (In theory, doing anything that destroys the penny might be illegal)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Depending on the year the penny was made, they might have different compositions.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Toys:</b> You'd be surprised how sophisticated most modern toys are. Gears, motors, wires, there's so much to use them for once you grow up.</li>
            <li><b>Old Electronics:</b> If you're lucky, you might have old electronics lying around the house, which will have all sorts of interesting metals and electrical components. Nile Red has some good videos on recycling these, though these days recycling centers might be more encouraged as certain materials are becoming more scarce.</li>
            <li><b>Cleaning Solutions:</b> Can contain sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, or sulfuric acid.</li>
            <li><b>Aluminum Foil:</b> Everyone has aluminum at home.</li>
            <li><b>Nails/Screws:</b> Often made of iron, zinc, or other metals/alloys.</li>
            <li><b>Bottles (jars, medication, etc.):</b> Good for storing things, and if you don't invest in beakers, bottles are generally more spatious.</li>
            <li><b>Red Cabbages:</b> Known for being a natural pH indicator.</li>
            <li><b>Pens:</b> Contain springs, and once you use up the ink, removing the tip gives you a thin plastic tube (a capillary tube). The outer casing of the pen can be used to control liquid flow: you can attach a tube to the top and flow liquids through it.</li>
            <li><b>Anything made of wood:</b> We like wood.</li>
            <li><b>Graphite from pencils:</b> Good material, and has high resistance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Hobby Knife:</b> While scissors work for most things, hobby knives are useful when you want better precision.</li>
            <li><b>Tape:</b> Most people have tape of different kinds at home.</li>
            <li><b>Plastic Tubing:</b> Generally fun to put liquids through, but also useful for moving liquids and playing with pressure.</li>
            <li><b>Screwdriver Set:</b> Useful for taking apart things (though you can also just break things).</li>
            <li><b>Lighter:</b> Set things on fire (ahem... flame tests).</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
