            <h2>Huh...</h2>
            <p>I was motivated to make this note because I feel like I didn't learn PDEs as thoroughly as I wanted to the semester I took it. Also, I want my study of PDEs in this sketch to contain many many more pictures than a book like Evans, which I felt could have used many more pictures (although I guess it did have a few). Finally, I want this summary to supplement the material covered in many PDEs courses by giving examples of the application of the theory of PDEs to study things in
            <ul>
                <li>Quantum Mechanics</li>
                <li>Differential and Complex Geometry</li>
                <li>Fluid Mechanics</li>
            </ul>
            (I might slip in some applications of ODEs as well, but don't hate me for it). Finally, I want to talk about a philosophical remark I vaguely remember my physics teacher making in freshman year:
            <blockquote>
                <i>Most physical phenomena can be modeled very nearly by a second-order differential equation. </i>
                <p style="text-align: right">- May or may not have been said by Prof. Benjamin Safdi</p>
            </blockquote>
            I honestly might be remembering it a bit (or completely) wrong, but we can maybe try in this sketch to see if we can reconstruct his message from my painfully bad memory. ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜œ I'll even see if I have a picture from the class he said it! I really enjoyed his lab class!

              As Strichartz put it in his amazing book, sometimes it doesn't make so much sense to worry about individual points $x$. Read the first few pages of his book for a more thorough explanation, but the idea is that we can better understand these functions by "testing" them with test functions.
