        I was on hiatus from this for a while because I was trying to go all out in the fall, taking excessive amounts of coursework, IM sports, research, grad apps, etc., which was fun and definitely an experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now I'm back. I'm home right now, so I'm going to focus on calisthenics and record a diary here. Since that's a lot of work, I'm going to stick to minimal entries rather than my older style below which was nice but not really sustainable.
      </p>

        I decided to make a quick update since it's been some time! I've been seeing some pretty cool advancements in my weight-lifting abilities! The first week, I failed to finish 5 sets of 5 on bench press with 95 pounds, but now I hit 5x5 with 100 pounds yesterday! I also feel much more comfortable doing squats and deadlifts with the barbell, and I think my dumbell overhead press has gotten better.
      </p>

      <p>
        That being said, my shoulder has been hurting a lot more than usual, so I've been taking things a bit slow (so the missing days on my sheet below are less of a consistency issue). Hopefully that will get better soon. Oddly, the pain hasn't actually been impacting my workouts too much... for some reason I even feel that the pain gets better during my workouts, and I only notice it when I'm not working out. I'm not sure if this is a good sign or a bad sign.
      </p>

      <p>
        So far I've been seeing strength improvements, which I'm happy about! Can't wait to reach a plate in a few weeks!
      </p>

      <p>
        My food habits haven't been amazing, so I think I could probably be getting better gains. This is something I'll try to work on in the coming weeks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>June 1, 2025, 10:48 PM PST</u><br/><br/>

        I've tried to get into weight lifting or calisthenics a few times before, but never really got into it. This time, I'm trying to be more serious about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first problem for me is what to do. I have a few go to exercises that I enjoy:
        <ul>
          <li>Bench press</li>
          <li>Leg press (I never really enjoyed the squat rack because I can't figure out how to place the bar on my back without my neck hurting significantly afterwards)</li>
          <li>Machines</li>
        </ul>
        but to be honest, I've never really locked in a good program and stuck to it. Being too afraid to try deadlifts and overhead presses was also a major problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        A friend of mine recommended StrongLifts 5x5, but I've seen mixed reviews. I'm a little skeptical since he claimed he tried it after he was already into weight lifting, which is not the case for me. StrongLifts tends to advertise itself as a program for beginners, but I've also seen pretty mixed reviews on Reddit, with some people going as far as to say that Mehdi doesn't know what he's talking about. I feel the same about nsuns, and many programs that I've heard good things about are paid.
      </p>

      <p>
        In spite of my skepticism, I'll probably start with StrongLifts 5x5 and see how it goes. Learning without making any mistakes would be ideal but feels pretty inorganic anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        For my nutrition plan, I'm aiming to eat roughly 3000 calories a day, which is more than before. I'm trying to eat a lot of carbs and protein for dinner after an evening workout.
      </p>

      <p>
        To stay more disciplined, I'm going to track my progress in three ways:
        <ol>
          <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JRpJbReA3-GwSFKLorYWpvKGQhmgLaaBP74dY2uRSDo/edit?usp=sharing">The StrongLifts 5x5 Spreadsheet (New lifter tab)</a></li>
          <li>Cronometer for nutrition tracking</li>
          <li>This diary</li>
        </ol>
        Looking forward to it! 
      </p>

        I actually continued through the summer which was solid. I was able to recover much of my muscle from before. However, with graduate applications and research, I wanted to temporarily sacrifice this program to focus and see what I can do to improve my research repetoire first. My current plan is to be on hiatus until January 2026.
